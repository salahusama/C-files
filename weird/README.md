##Matrix Program

This will generate a random Matrix, then find a target number (set to 3 by default) and change that row and column to 0s.

This was a challenge when I started coding. Hard coded matrix size and target just to prove concept.

1 bug exists. Easy fix, but I understand it, so I didnt feel a need to change it (as I know how).
